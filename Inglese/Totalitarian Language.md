## 1. Introduction: The problem
- A political reality is determined bt political discourse and political
formulas
- In a political regime is important the control over the dissemination of
political information. 
    - Authoritarianism and totalitarianism are characterized
    by a stringent control over the information flow.
    - Democracy presupposes free flow of information.
- Totalitarianism is control over the entire social system:
    - The communication in this regime is like a monologue, so only one person
    speaks and the rest listen.
    - There is the idolization of the public consciousness (referred as 
    Polarization of the mind).
    - Language becames only an instrument to suppress free thought (not only 
    speech). It is used to alter people's consciousness.
    - Messages are centered around things that the population wants (like 
    hearing that "it will all be alright" after a difficult period) and
    patronizing the leaders, presenting them as a fatherly figure.  
    Some times the leaders are worshipped and a sort of cult is created around
    them. Their powers are also sacralized.
- Language has the following characteristics:
    - propaganda-style triumphalism: exaggeration of the importance of social
    accomplishments
    - common usage of idolization, attribution of symbolic meanings to political
    concepts
    - exaggerated abstraction and scientism, active use of generalized logic
    - heightened criticism, not genuine
    - claims to be the absolute truth
    - slogan-style language

## 2: Fascism
- Mussolini is known as one of the most eloquent orators.
- He used a simple, yet not primitive, but traditional, language: he didn't use 
allusions, scientific or difficult worlds, that makes his speeches universally 
accessible.
- He used a clear structure, using many pauses. On example is the speech of 10
June 1940 (war declaration)
- He used infinite form verbs (like "Listen"), this gives the speech some sort 
of sacrality, like if he was a prophet and makes the listening crow more 
engaged.
- He didn't ask question, but only proclaims and declares.
- Naming the enemy comes with polarization (he calls them "plutocratic and 
reactionary democracies of the west"). This is also used to compare Italy with 
its enemies.
- It uses morality to justify its decisions (they said that they didn't want the
war, but that the Europe wanted it, so Italy should pair up with Germany)
- It makes people feel special (tells them they have a mission, the war and that
they must not fear the "ultimate test").
