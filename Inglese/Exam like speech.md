### Communication Protocols
- used to communicate
	- outside of technology, driving system
	- inside technology, internet
- firstly used with the telegraph
	- Morse code

#### Stack ISO OSI
- The internet grow larger and larger
- A standard method of connection needed to be used
- The stack ISO OSI is a theoretical model which a real life correspondence
- Divided in 7 levels
	- The first is the physical transport medium
	- The second works with MAC addresses
	- The third works with Ip addresses
	- The fourth works with TCP or UDP protocols
	- The seventh works with ports and sockets and has higher level protocols

#### Sockets
- Sockets are a basic method to create a peer to peer connection between two computers.
- They create an effective channel to exchange data using an IP address and a port.
We used them in java.

#### High level protocols
- Using sockets, it is possible to transmit any kind of data, so more protocols are created. 
- The most popular are the HTTP and HTTPS protocols (and their derivate REST), which are used everywhere in the modern web.
- They permit to send and receive information, even in crypted form.

#### Encryption
- Data in modern is very sensitive and needs to be protected
- So it is encrypted
- A popular algorithm is the RSA. It uses the modulo math function.

#### Browsers and WebApps
- browsers are the most used way to share information
- they use HTTP
- webapps are apps for the browsers

#### Tomcat
- implementation of serverside-rendered webapps
- implementation of rest API

#### PHP
- name
- implementation of serverside-rendered webapps
- facebook
- SQL integration

#### Data Storage
- classical archives
- databases
- sql
- servers

#### Data privacy
- the General data protection regulation is a EU law entered in charge in 2018
- defines what and how data can be processed
- defines right to the user that possesses the data, for example to be tutelated, and the right to be forgotten
